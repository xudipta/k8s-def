# Release notes

Turn merged PRs since the last release into grouped, human-readable notes.

## Steps

1. Run `scripts/collect_prs.sh [<since-tag>]` to get the raw list of merged PRs
   (title, number, labels, author) since the last tag, as JSON on stdout.
   If the repo has no tags, the script falls back to the first commit.
2. Group entries by type, inferred from the conventional-commit prefix in the title
   or from labels: **Features**, **Fixes**, **Docs**, **Internal**.
3. For each entry write: `- <imperative summary> (#<number>)`. Rewrite terse titles
   into a readable sentence; drop pure chore/CI entries from user-facing sections.
4. Emit Markdown with an `## <next version>` heading. Ask the user for the version
   string if it is not obvious from the tags.
5. Show the draft and ask before writing it to `CHANGELOG.md`.
